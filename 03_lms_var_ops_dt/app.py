# Concepts Covered - Variables, Data Types, Operators

# Student Details
student_id = 101
student_name = "Ravi"
student_age = 20

# Scores Details
quiz_score = 80
assignment_score = 95
exam_score = 90

# Attendance Details
student_attendance = 95

# Use arithmetic operators to calculate
total_score = quiz_score + assignment_score + exam_score # addition operator
average_score = total_score / 3 # division operator

# Use relational operators to determine
# If the student is passing based on average score 75
is_passed = average_score >= 75 # False

# Use increment operator to update
# Attendance (simulate an additional attended session)
student_attendance = student_attendance + 1 # Correct -> Long Syntax
student_attendance += 1 # Correct -> Concise Syntax (Compound Assignment Operators)


# Use logical operators to determine award eligibility
# If the student qualifies for an award 
# (requires high attendance i.e 90 and above and a passing grade)
qualified_award = student_attendance >= 90 and is_passed

# Academic Performance Section: Individual scores, total, and average
